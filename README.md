# Maze Generator and Solver

This Java program generates and solves a maze using depth-first search (DFS) for maze generation and breadth-first search (BFS) for maze solving. The program uses the `DUDraw` library for drawing the maze and handling user interactions.

## Features

- **Generate Maze**: Generates a maze using depth-first search.
- **Solve Maze**: Solves the generated maze using breadth-first search.

## Usage

**Generate Maze**:
- The maze is generated automatically when the program starts.
**Solve Maze**:
- The maze is solved automatically after generation.
**Code Overview**
